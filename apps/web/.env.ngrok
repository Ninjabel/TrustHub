### Environment overrides for running the web app behind ngrok
### Replace the example value below with your ngrok public URL (including protocol),
### for example: https://abcd-1234-5678.ngrok.io
# Example:
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-ngrok-id.ngrok.io"
# If your deployment needs an internal url variable, set it as well (optional):
NEXTAUTH_URL_INTERNAL="https://your-ngrok-id.ngrok.io"

# You can also include NEXTAUTH_SECRET if you want the same secret used during build/start:
# NEXTAUTH_SECRET="replace-with-your-secret"

# Notes:
# - After changing the URL you must rebuild the app so the client bundles include the correct
#   NEXTAUTH_URL. Use the helper script at the repo root: `start-with-ngrok.ps1` (it will
#   auto-detect ngrok if running locally) or run a manual build with the environment set.
